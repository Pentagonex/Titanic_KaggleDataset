Welcome to the **Titanic Machine Learning for Disaster** repository! This project focuses on analyzing the **Titanic - Machine Learning for Disaster** dataset from Kaggle, exploring patterns, behaviors, and information that may be useful in predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. We then create a model using machine learning techniques to predict whether each passenger survived the disaster or not.

## Repository Details
- **Repository Name**: Titanic_KaggleDataset
- **Description**: A study of data from the Titanic - Machine Learning for Disaster dataset from Kaggle, looking for patterns, behaviors, and information that may be useful. After that, a model is created trying to predict if each passenger of the Titanic survived or not.
- **Topics**: data-science, data-visualization, eda, gridsearchcv, kaggle, kaggle-competition, random-forest, random-forest-classifier, titanic-kaggle, titanic-survival-prediction

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Titanic - Machine Learning for Disaster** dataset provided by Kaggle. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived the disaster. This dataset is commonly used for machine learning practice and competitions due to its historical significance and the challenge of predicting passenger survival.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: We start by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we explore relationships between variables and identify patterns in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: We create new features or modify existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Building**: Using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier, we build a model to predict passenger survival based on the available data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.

## Results
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately determines whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived the disaster. By analyzing the dataset, understanding key factors that influence survival, and leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to create a reliable model for predicting outcomes.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries and dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and model creation process.
4. Explore the findings, visualizations, and model performance metrics.
5. Utilize the model to make predictions on new data or test its accuracy on different datasets.
